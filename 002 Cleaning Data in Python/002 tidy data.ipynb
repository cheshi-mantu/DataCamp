    "### Reshaping your data using melt\n",
    "Melting data is the process of turning columns of your data into rows of data. Consider the DataFrames from the previous exercise. In the tidy DataFrame, the variables Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp each had their own column. If, however, you wanted these variables to be in rows instead, you could melt the DataFrame. In doing so, however, you would make the data untidy! This is important to keep in mind: Depending on how your data is represented, you will have to reshape it differently (e.g., this could make it easier to plot values).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will practice melting a DataFrame using pd.melt(). There are two parameters you should be aware of: id_vars and value_vars. The id_vars represent the columns of the data you do not want to melt (i.e., keep it in its current shape), while the value_vars represent the columns you do wish to melt into rows. By default, if no value_vars are provided, all columns not set in the id_vars will be melted. This could save a bit of typing, depending on the number of columns that need to be melted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (tidy) DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded. Your job is to melt its Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns into rows. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to bring this melted DataFrame back into a tidy form."

    "So far, you've used the .pivot_table() method when there are multiple index values you want to hold constant during a pivot. In the video, Dan showed you how you can also use pivot tables to deal with duplicate values by providing an aggregation function through the aggfunc parameter. Here, you're going to combine both these uses of pivot tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say your data collection method accidentally duplicated your dataset. Such a dataset, in which each row is duplicated, has been pre-loaded as airquality_dup. In addition, the airquality_melt DataFrame from the previous exercise has been pre-loaded. Explore their shapes in the IPython Shell by accessing their .shape attributes to confirm the duplicate rows present in airquality_dup.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see that by using .pivot_table() and the aggfunc parameter, you can not only reshape your data, but also remove duplicates. Finally, you can then flatten the columns of the pivoted DataFrame using .reset_index().\n",
